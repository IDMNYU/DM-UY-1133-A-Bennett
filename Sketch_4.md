##Sketch 4 - Vectors 

### Due March 28th

1. Take one of your previous exercises (or build a new sketch) and add vectors to it to creation motion. Also program in some sort of mechanism or system that activates the process. Add vectors for velocity and acceleration. 

2. Then make the graphics make things move


Bonus:

- create multiple objects with different velocities and accelerations. Store them in an array.

- Have these objects move towards different goals: the mouse, a particular graphic/monster, etc.
