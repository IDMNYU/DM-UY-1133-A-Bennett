Project 1

**Due March 7 --> In class critiques**

**20% of your final grade**

Weekly pushes and changes are expected

Pick an adjective and make a program that illustrates that adjective interactively. You may not use images.  Only drawing functions, meaning mostly stuff found in the ‘graphics’ section.


Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Make sure to read Learning Processing Chapters 13 + 14, as well as the Generative Design Text.

Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?

Ingredients: Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custom shapes), Control Structures (if, for, while), Movement, Interaction (mouse, keyboard), Custom functions with passing parameters, Arrays Math, Random.

Must haves:
	- custom functions passing variables as parameters
	- loops
	- control structures
	- math or random
	- some use of interaction or change over time
	- movement, change, variety
	- arrays
	- conditionals
	


Code must be 100 lines of custom code, a minimum. Spacing, comments or commented out code are not counted as lines.

Weekly pushes to your OpenProcessing/GitHub Repo are required
