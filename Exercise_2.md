###Exercise 2

####Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern

 This is a 2-part Exercise



Part 1:

 Using 1 form/shape and create 6 drastically different grid patterns. Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. 

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique


Part 2:

Once you have that pattern created, how can you use it as a drawing tool/instrument or send it values to animate it across space based upon an input?
 - how could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change?
