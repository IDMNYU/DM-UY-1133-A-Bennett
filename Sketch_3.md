 ###P5.js transition + Functions with parameters


 1.) Take your first sketch (monster) and translate it to the P5.js platform. Make sure that it functions in the browser properly!

 2.) Organize your monster into functions, nesting other functions inside. For example, you could call fraggle(), and it would call other functions (ex, head, neck, tenacles, etc) that would individually contain their drawing elements. Matrix transformations can be quite handy here. Use variables for the x and y positions that are passed with the function call. Doing so will enable you to have multiples on the screen in varying locations.

 3.) Further organize those functions, into requiring variables for particular aspects that you wish to vary - width, height, color, variety, etc etc. Then call that function 3 times, passing different parameters, that then show 3 monsters that have similiarites as well as variations.


 Bonus: 4.) Create an array that stores some parameter. Ex. hair colors, # of appendages, # of eyes, etc. Use a for-loop to iterate through the array, passing the array's indice to a monster function call.
